## About The Project

This repository is my journey in improving my frontend development skills.

Here's why:
* I've noticed I am having a hard time creating components in react using tailwind css.
* Doing this exercises will make me a better frontend Developer as well as giving me a better perspective on thinking in terms of components and how they interact.
* Improve my designing skills in the way.
